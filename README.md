# groovin_material_icons

This Flutter package is a fork of community_material_icons, which seems to have been abandoned. There are some icons that the original developer added to the repo, but was never released on pub. This package includes those icons.

If you find any icons that are not in the package and should be, please either open an issue linking to the icon or fork the repo, add the icon yourself, and open a pull request

## How to contribue
1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the repo to your machine
3. Add your new IconData. Make sure that you know the codePoint for your icon. Check https://cdn.materialdesignicons.com/2.6.95/ for your icon if it is an icon that the community has already created. If you have an svg icon, you can upload it to http://fluttericon.com/ to generate a custom font that will tell you exactly how to add your icon to the package.
4. Commit your code to your repo
5. Open a pull request
